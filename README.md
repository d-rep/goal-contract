The purpose of this web application is to give people motivation to meet their goals by allowing the creation of a contract that will be locked in, and requiring a separate person to validate that their goals were achieved after the deadline happens. This is also meant to be a replacement for Development Plans that people will actually use.


Getting Up & Running

This project requires NodeJS and NPM (I used v0.10.26 and 2.5.0, respectively).

    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:drep/goal-contract.git
    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ npm start

Other things you probably need to run:

    npm install -g bower
    npm install -g grunt
    npm install -g node-dev
